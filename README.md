# Line Following Robot Using Arduino  

## Project Overview  
A **Line-Following Robot** is an autonomous system designed to navigate along a marked path using IR sensors. In hospitals, it can assist with tasks like transporting supplies, guiding patients, or delivering items efficiently. The Arduino processes sensor data to control motor direction, ensuring smooth navigation and obstacle avoidance.  

## Features  
- Black line follower for precise navigation.  
- Request receiving system using an IR sensor.  
- Obstacle detection with an IR proximity sensor.  
- Patient serving mechanism using servo motors.  

## Working (Steps)  
1. The robot follows a black line on the floor using IR sensors.  
2. IR sensors detect patient requests and send data to the Arduino.  
3. Proximity sensors identify obstacles and adjust the robotâ€™s movement.  
4. Servo motors are activated to serve the patient or deliver items.    

## Technologies Used    
- **Sensors**: IR sensor, IR proximity sensor 
- **Actuators**: Servo motors  
- **Control Unit**: Arduino(Microcontroller)
- **Power Supply**: Rechargeable battery pack
